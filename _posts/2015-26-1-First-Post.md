Trying out GitHub website hosting with Jekyll. Setup was pretty smooth considering I used an excelent template by Barry Clark called [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) . His tutorial is clear an concise and he also offers links
to some other Jekyll themes but I have no reason to switch right now. My next step would be to check some plugins out and customize the Jekyll experience on my personal blog.
